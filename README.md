🏨 Sanjay's Hospitality Dashboard 🧳
A Data Analysis Project in Hospitality Domain with PowerBI

Inspired by Codebasics 🛎️

🎯 Motivation :
In this project, I followed the tutorial by codebasics on YouTube to learn how to build a data analysis dashboard using Power BI. The tutorial features Abhishek Anand, a revenue manager at OYO, and Hemanand, a data analytics expert. I learned the real time process of discussing client requirements, mocking up a dashboard, understanding hospitality domain metrics, cleaning and formatting data, performing data modeling, and creating calculated metrics using DAX.

🚀 Features
The dashboard includes the following features:

Revenue: Visualizes revenue trends over time.
Occupancy %: Displays the percentage of occupied rooms over a selected period.
RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Calculates and presents the revenue generated per available room.
DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Shows the number of sellable room nights per day.
ADR (Average Daily Rate): Presents the average rate per room per day.
DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Illustrates the number of rooms booked per day.
DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Displays the number of rooms utilized per day.
Weekly Metrics Trends: Visualizes the trends of various metrics on a weekly basis.
Revenue by City and Category: Provides insights into revenue generated by different cities and hotel categories.
